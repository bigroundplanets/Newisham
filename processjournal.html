            Part of the conceit of modernity is that, to solve our problems, we need more high-tech solutions.
            <br>
             But many of our problems are caused by technology in the first place—consider nuclear weapons, air pollution, climate change, and industrial food waste. On the other hand,
             <br> fermentation is low-tech. You don’t need to be an expert to preserve food, or any fancy technology. Just a bucket, some salt, and trust in the world of bacteria and fungi.''

            <h2> TO DO </h2>
            - make a small presentation about the green boxes - intrested in the documentation 
            - investigate into the wires outside my house - stealing my neighbours wifi 
            <a href="hmm.html"> Here </a>
            - investigate into what the great space satalites of lewisham are <br>
            - investigate into making a radio <br>
            - investigate into river openings - rivers as infrastructure <br> 
            - I can't stop thinking about the moon <br>
            - data set made by things i've found/seen on the floor and where
            - what is happening in that ghosts video 
        </div>

        <div> 
            <h2> The great satalites of Lewisham (Lewisham space station) </h2>
            according to a lady on next door, Paula Cornish, they are virgin media satalites on the old virgin media building<br>
            Paula Cornish knows this because her husband works there apparently. 
            <br> 
            - maybe for more information I could look into the Lewisham council infastructure documents

        <p> ANALYSIS

            You must demonstrate some analysis of your project. Your analysis should look at your question from different scales: what does this infrastructure mean on a personal, local level? How does this relate to larger, more political issues?
            
            Questions we will ask (in our heads) while assessing your presentations:
            
            · What technical components have you used in this project?
            
            · What did you learn from your research?
            
            · How did your research lead into the way you’ve chosen to represent it? What did you learn from that process?</p>

            <h2> The mapping of injustice in a accesibly way - by giving people accesible understanding it gives people agnecy 
                to talk and feel confident resisting them  - INVESTIGATION IS ABOUT EMPOWERMENT
            </h2>

           'They realized that map-making is an act that centers how those in power — those tasked with making the maps from the top down <br>
            — understand the world. Exercising this knowledge, the DGEI produced what they called "oughtness maps": "maps of how <br>
             things are and maps of how things ought to be"2, with the goal of depicting exactly what the master planners' maps leave out,<br>
              producing a "radical cartography of murder sites, pedestrian paths, commuter traffic, and race relations"3, as well as <br>
               finding ways to assert their own visions for a better Detroit.' - https://spaceandtim.es/etc/the_world_any_other_way/

               Map-making is conventionally understood as a neutral act of description, one which represents the contours of space <br>
                and the arrangement of things within it in a way that reflects the physical world. Rather than seen as an editorial <br>
                 act of perspective, interpretation, emphasization, and assertion, whatever a map depicts is taken for granted as
                 <br> real and inevitable. <br>

                 The maps put forward by the urban planners of Detroit were understood to express all that is and all that could be: <br>
                 the inevitable expansion of development rights and displacement, as if it were a force of nature <br>

                 To program a simulation, we specify the rules we believe govern a subject system, <br>
                 Because this articulation needs to legible to a computer, this whole process is less forgiving of ambiguity than <br> 
                 other ways we can describe how a system works — in an essay, <br> 
                 a conversation, a tweet, a map, and so on. The stricter requirement for explicit, detailed theories of what governs <br>
                  a system is what makes simulation so different. <br>

                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  the quality of a simulation is based on how accurately it is able to reproduce the target system's dynamics <br>
                   (its predictive power) against the simplicity of its rules. <br>
